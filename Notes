Point3 Class comes from Panda3d:
A three-component point in space (as opposed to a vector, which represents a direction and a distance).
(float x, float y, float z)

What happens when you hit this object?
self.myModel.setCollisionCallback(MovingObject.chooseme)
chooseme can be:
MovingObject.handleRepelCollision # don't let colliding objects to into one another
MovingObject.handleSlideCollision # colliding objects slide along each other

if this is an object you care about the collision:
make a method:
self.myModel.collideMe
where:
def collideMe(self, collisionInfoList):
allows you to use this:
collisionInfoList[0].getInto().getIdentifier()
to get the id of what you collided with.
